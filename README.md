The main purpose of the research was the redesign of the program of occupational
safety and health (PSSL) for The Maracaibo Polyclinic, with the purpose of adjust
The PSSL to the NT-01-2008. The current situation is characterized by a poorly
developed program, with a several lacking content and without the proper
adherence to the aforementioned technical standard. This research was
descriptive, based on a design field and documental where were used data
collection techniques such as observation and the analysis that led to the diagnosis
and the evaluation of the current PSSL which involved workers of the main areas
of the Polyclinic. Among the instruments of data collection was made a checklist to
diagnose failures of The PSSL, based on NT-01-2008, similarly was applied some
structured interviews to understand the fundamental procedures in the most critical
areas of The Polyclinic and finally was created an observation guide to perform a
vulnerability analysis of the facilities of the institution. The research was divided
into five phases, which include the diagnosis of failures in the PSSL, the
establishment of working procedures, the development of a new contingency plan,
the development of rules of hygiene and safety for contractors and finally the
redesign of The PSSL, therefore some corrective actions were applied to the
failures presented by the program to conform to current standards, while it is
recommended the publication or disclosure of it to make it known to all workers
and their review by the committee of safety and health at least once a year.
